## Details

## U-Net
U-Net is a Convolutional Neural Network architecture built for Biomedical Image Segementation (specifically, 
segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks). 

> The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization.

The precise architecture is shown here:
